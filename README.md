# Sentiment Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It classifies text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on the input dataset.

## 📂 Project Architecture
1. **Data Collection**: Importing dataset containing text and corresponding sentiment labels.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning text, tokenization, removing stopwords, and stemming/lemmatization.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Converting text data into numerical representations using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
4. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or Deep Learning models like LSTMs).
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Visualization**: Displaying results through dashboards and charts.
